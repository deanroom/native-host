# A native hosting extension for dotnet app with aot

Please reference @https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/design/features/native-hosting.md  and @https://github.com/dotnet/samples/tree/main/core/hosting, I want to create a demo to do the things :

1. Create a project to support native hosting as a library, it means that I want to use a dotnet app with aot and then load external assembly with this this library that build with cmake.
2. This library should support windows/linux/macos, there is unit test for this library.
3. Provide a demo app and dotnet library to show how to use this library.
